
NOTE:  NJasmine is known to work with 2.5.7.  There is a known issue preventing it from working with 2.5.8+, which I need to fix.


In order to build this project, you need to execute the psake build script from the PowerShell console.
You do this using the following command from the root project directory:

	.\psake.ps1 default.ps1
	
You may need to allow script execution by running the following command as adminstrator:

	Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
	


To build and deploy the addin, you can run:
    .\psake.ps1 .\default.ps1 TestDeploy
	
    This will install the addon to the copy of nunit at .\NJasmine\packages\NUnit.2.5.7.10213.  The addin is only available when running NUnit from that path.
	
If you'd be willing to run all tests, :)
	.\psake.ps1
	
If you want to deploy the addin to the local install of NUnit on a Windows machine:
    .\psake.ps1 .\default.ps1 LocalDeploy
	
    With it installed locally, you still need to run NUnit from c:\program files(x86)\nunit*\bin\net-2.0\addins
